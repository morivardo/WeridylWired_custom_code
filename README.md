# Blog

In this repository you can find:
- HTML files used to create some blog content;
- Some CSS files containing stylistic changes to pages or elements of the blog, which were then merged into a single file;
- The final CSS file with all the stylistic changes, actually used for the site;

P.S. The final CSS file has been updated and corrected to fix errors and issues. So not all the corrections are visible also in the other CSS files.
